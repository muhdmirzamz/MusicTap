##MusicTap##

Just an idea project or concept. Alright so the idea is that you pick a song and you start drawing. The degree of decibals of the song will determine your line width. So, if your song is currently playing at the soft section of its playtime, your width will be defaulted to 2. As the decibals increase, the width will increase to like 5 or 10. So you can see your line become thick and thin. You're pretty much drawing depending on the music.

Controls:
- Tap once with one finger to choose a song
- Tap twice with two fingers to stop a song
